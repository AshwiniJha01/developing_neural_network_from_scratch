# developing_neural_network_from_scratch
This repository is a learning exercise where I have developed a Neural Network function in Python from scratch.
This is a learning exercise. The neural network function can perform binary classification using a variety of number of layers, number of neurons in each layer and epochs. Learning rate is also a user input. The activation function is limited to sigmoid.
